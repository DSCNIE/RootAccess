        <h4>Food waste management systems are designed to reduce the amount of food waste created by businesses and households. These systems typically involve practices such as composting, recycling, and anaerobic digestion. Such systems can also involve infrastructure changes, such as the implementation of collection systems that make it easier for businesses and households to separate and properly dispose of their food waste.<br><br>
         Every day, food businesses throw out high-quality, delicious food. It could be pallets of fresh bell peppers that aren’t the ideal shape. Or carrots that are a little crooked. Or milk that was over-ordered for a local school district. Point is, it’s food that could feed people rather than ending up in a landfill. In India, the larger the marriage, the larger the party, and also the additional stupendous the waste. No doubt weddings and banquets are an enormous supply of food wastage, however, restaurants and hotels conjointly contribute to food wastage. Nearly 14% of the total food produced globally is lost between the harvest and retail stages. India's contribution to wasted food, at <span>68.8 million tonnes</span> annually, is 7% of the global total, per the United Nations Environment Programme's Food Waste Index Report 2021. <br> <br>
        Here, <span>Zer0 Hunger</span> comes into picture. We came up with an initiative to reduce the food wastage and hunger as much as possible with the goal of zero hunger and responsible consumption and production. We have our outlets in different parts of the country. We are in contact with some banquets. We collect the donated food and distribute it among the people who need it. <br> <br>

        <h4> <span>Zer0 Hunger</span> is alligned with the 2nd United Nations SDP goals out of the 17 which states <br> 
            <b>"End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture"</b>
            <br><br>
            Zero Hunger addresses the critical issue of food wastage by establishing a connection between locations with surplus food and those facing food scarcity. By bridging the gap, the initiative ensures that excess food is redirected to areas in need, minimizing waste and contributing to the global goal of eliminating hunger. This sustainable approach not only combats food wastage but also strives to create a world where no one goes hungry, fostering a more equitable distribution of resources and promoting a resilient and efficient food supply chain.
