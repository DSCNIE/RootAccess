        <h2>THE ISSUE</h2>
        <p style ="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
          Cloth waste is a major contributor to pollution and climate change. In
          2018, around 25 million tons of textile waste was generated globally,
          with approximately 10 million tons being sent to landfills. This
          contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, leading to
          respiratory issues and increased risk of health problems.

          developing nation. This serves as a stark reminder of the sheer volume
          of waste generated by fast fashion.

          <li style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 17px;"><b>Pollution</b>: Synthetic fibers from discarded clothing often end

          <li style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 17px;"><b>Economic Impact</b>: Lost Profits: The fashion industry loses a
          staggering 500 billion dollars annually due to clothing waste. This
          highlights the financial consequences of unsustainable production and
          consumption practices.

          international collaboration to tackle this global issue. This includes
          holding production and manufacturing companies accountable for the
          lifecycle of their products, including disposal and recycling.
