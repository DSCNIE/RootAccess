      <h2>The Issue</h2>
      <p>
        Cloth waste is a major contributor to pollution and climate change. In
        2018, around 25 million tons of textile waste was generated globally,
        with approximately 10 million tons being sent to landfills. This
        contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, leading to
        respiratory issues and increased risk of health problems. Environmental
        Impact: Mountains of Waste: The video opens with a shocking image - a
        vast pile of discarded clothing in a developing nation. This serves as a
        stark reminder of the sheer volume of waste generated by fast fashion.
        Slow Decomposition: The narrator highlights that clothes made from
        synthetic fabrics, like polyester, can take hundreds of years to
        decompose in landfills, posing a long-term environmental threat.
        Waterway Pollution: Synthetic fibers from discarded clothing often end
        up in waterways, harming marine life and polluting ecosystems. Economic
        Impact: Lost Profits: The video reveals a surprising statistic: the
        fashion industry loses a staggering 500 billion dollars annually due to
        clothing waste. This highlights the financial consequences of
        unsustainable production and consumption practices. Call to Action:
        International Cooperation: The video emphasizes the need for
        international collaboration to tackle this global issue. This includes
        holding production and manufacturing companies accountable for the
        lifecycle of their products, including disposal and recycling.
